# LinearRL - Python Implementation
This repository is a Python implementation of LinearRL originally formulated by Piray et al. <br>
The original work can be found here: ["Linear reinforcement learning in planning, grid fields, and cognitive control"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25123-3). 
## Introduction
The code converts the LinearRL framework introduced by Piray et al. into a Python framework. Additionally, it is converted to be used with OpenAI's Gym reinforcement learning environments. <br> <br>
Currently, due to the nature of the code. It only works on tabular environemnts.
## Usage
