# Gymnasium Environments
This directory contains the code I used to create custom gymnasium environments. <br> <br>

The environments in here are all either environments that were used in the original linear RL paper to demonstrate its effectiveness or cognitive neuroscience inspired environments.

## From Paper
### 10x10 Maze
I create a similar maze to that was used in the linear RL paper (fig 2d.)

## Cognitive Neuroscience
### Hairpin Maze


### Tolman's Detour Task
Maze environment inspired by [Tolman's detour task ](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1949-00103-001)
